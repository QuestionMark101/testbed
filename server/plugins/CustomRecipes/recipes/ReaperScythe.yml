  Lore:
  - '&4“A blade forged from the essence of death itself,'
  - '&4it reaps not only souls but the echoes of life'
  - '&4that linger beyond.”'
  - ' '
  - '&c"Long ago, when the balance between life and death'
  - '&cwas first forged, there was a being known as the'
  - '&cEternal Reaper. Tasked with guiding the dead to their'
  - '&cfinal rest, the Reaper carried a scythe imbued'
  - '&cwith unfathomable power. It is said the weapon'
  - '&ccould slice through the fabric of existence,'
  - '&cseparating soul from body with a single swing. '
  - '&cWhen the Eternal Reaper was vanquished in an ancient'
  - '&cwar of gods, their scythe was shattered, scattering'
  - '&cits shards across realms."'
  - ' '
  - '&c"In time, fragments of the scythe were discovered by mortals,'
  - '&cwho sought to reforge the weapon for their own ends. Only one'
  - '&csucceeded—a forgotten necromancer who bound the weapon with the'
  - '&cessence of their own life. The result was the Reaper Scythe, a'
  - '&ctool of unimaginable strength that carried the whispers of death'
  - '&cwith every strike. Those who wield it do not merely fight; they'
  - '&ccommand the power of death itself."'
